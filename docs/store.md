# The memory store

All memory lives in one Postgres with pgvector, run in Docker and set up by LINA. The Honcho server
(api and deriver), built from `services/honcho`, runs beside it and keeps its tables in schema `ltm`.

| Schema | Holds |
| --- | --- |
| `memory` | messages |
| `ctx` | context summaries |
| `ltm` | long-term memory (the Honcho server's tables) |
| `vec` | embeddings |

## Installing

```sh
lina store install   # also run by `lina install`
lina store status
```

`install` needs Docker (Docker Desktop on a Mac). It builds the Honcho image from
`services/honcho`, starts the database, runs Honcho's migrations as one job, starts the api and the
deriver, and runs the smoke test (`GET /health`, `POST /v3/workspaces/list`, and the Alembic
revision in `ltm.alembic_version`). Run on a machine that already has a store, it upgrades instead
(see below).

The files are in `services/store/`: `compose.yaml` (compose project `lina-store`) and
`initdb/10-lina-store.sh`, which runs once on an empty cluster. One store serves every profile, so
its settings are under the LINA root, not a profile home, in `store/`:

| File | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `store.env` | Generated on first install (mode 0600): the three role passwords, the ports (Postgres `54320`, Honcho `8000`, both on 127.0.0.1) and the data volume's name |
| `honcho.env` | Honcho settings such as LLM and embedding keys (`LLM_*`, `EMBEDDING_*`); read by the api, deriver and migration job |
| `backups/` | Backup generations |

## Roles and row-level security

| Role | Used by | Can |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `lina` | `lina store` (over the container's local socket) | everything (cluster superuser) |
| `lina_app` | agents | read and write the tables in `memory`, `ctx` and `vec`; only the rows of its agent |
| `honcho` | the Honcho server | own schema `ltm` and migrate it |

Every table in `memory`, `ctx`, `ltm` or `vec` that has an `agent_id` column gets row-level
security when it is created (or gains the column): an event trigger enables and forces it and adds
the policy `lina_agent_rows`. A session says which agent it acts for with
`SET lina.agent_id = '<agent>'`; it then sees and writes only that agent's rows, and with no agent
set it sees none. The superuser `lina` is not limited by the policy.

## Backup and restore

```sh
lina store backup                 # one generation of the whole cluster
lina store backups                # list them
lina store restore [GENERATION]   # default: the newest
```

A generation is `store/backups/<UTC time>/`: `base.tar.gz` (`pg_basebackup` of the whole cluster,
WAL included) and `manifest.json` (its sha256, the Postgres version, and every table's row count
and row digest). The Honcho api and deriver are stopped while it is taken and started again
afterwards. It is written as `.partial-<time>` and renamed when complete, so an interrupted backup
never appears as a generation; the next backup deletes the leftover.

Restore refuses a generation whose archive does not match its sha256, naming the cause. Otherwise
it unpacks the archive into a new volume, switches `store.env` to it, sets the role passwords to the
ones in `store.env` (a cluster from another machine carries that machine's), and compares every
table with the manifest. If anything differs, the store goes back to its previous volume. The
volume the store used before is never deleted; `restore` prints its name.

To move the store to another machine, run `lina store install` there, copy a generation into its
`store/backups/`, and run `lina store restore`.

## Upgrading Honcho

After taking a new Honcho release into `services/honcho`:

```sh
lina store upgrade   # or: lina store install
```

1. **Backup**: a new generation.
2. **Rehearsal migration**: the new image is built (the old one stays as `lina-honcho:previous`),
   the backup is restored into a separate compose project (`lina-store-rehearsal`, its own volume
   and ports), the migration job and the smoke test run there, and the rehearsal is removed. If it
   fails, the store is not touched and the old image is tagged back.
3. **One job**: with the api and deriver stopped, the migration job runs once on the store.
4. **Smoke test**: the api and deriver start on the new image and the smoke test runs.

If step 3 or 4 fails, the message names the backup from step 1; `lina store restore <generation>`
puts the store back.
